# Pathfinding Visualizer

Features:
- 

Completed:
- Reset board
- Fixed randomized walls leading to empty paths
- Fix path building backwards
- When clicking on the grid, a wall is set (draggable)

Tasks:
- You can't properly reset board after only setting walls
- Ability to manually set the start, end and wall points
    - Start starts at a chosen point, and is draggable
    - Same with end point
- Stop board clear during visualizing pathing
- What happens when you click another button during another pathing?
- After all the above then you can try implementing other algos
- Add on second click to only re-visualize the path and not call the algorithm again (on 2nd click bookmark)

Clean-up tasks:
- Doesn't need to be responsive, just a github pages project
- Legend
- Host on Github pages

Algorithms:
- A*
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstras
